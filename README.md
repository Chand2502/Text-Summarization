# Text-Summarization
Extractive Text Summarization using Spacy

Description
Text summarization is a crucial task in natural language processing (NLP) aimed at condensing large volumes of text into shorter, more manageable summaries while retaining the essential information. This README focuses specifically on the extractive approach to text summarization.

The Extractive Text Summarization process involves several key steps:

Input Text from User: The process begins with the input text provided by the user. This could be in the form of a document, article, or any textual content that requires summarization.
Text Cleaning: Before summarization, the input text undergoes cleaning to remove any noise, such as special characters, punctuation, or irrelevant formatting, which could interfere with the summarization process.
Sentence Tokenization: The cleaned text is then segmented into individual sentences. Sentence tokenization is crucial for breaking down the text into manageable units for analysis.
Word Tokenization: Each sentence is further segmented into individual words or tokens. Word tokenization enables the analysis of the frequency of words within the text, a key aspect of extractive summarization.
Word-Frequency Table: A word-frequency table is generated based on the occurrence of each word in the text. This table provides valuable insights into the importance of each word within the context of the document.

Usage
To utilize the Extractive Text Summarization functionality:

Prepare Input Text: Provide the input text that you want to summarize.
Text Cleaning: If necessary, perform any required text cleaning to remove noise from the input text.
Tokenization: Segment the text into sentences and words using appropriate tokenization techniques.
Word-Frequency Analysis: Generate a word-frequency table to understand the importance of each word in the text.
Summarization: Utilize the provided algorithms or libraries to perform extractive summarization based on the word-frequency table and other relevant criteria.
